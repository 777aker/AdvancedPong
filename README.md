# AdvancedPong
A Pong game programmed with Java except there can be 4 or 2 players, they can move in any direction within their bounds, and there can be teams. To play download pong.jar and run it. A menu will present you with a few options. Players are WASD, IJKL, arrow keys and numpad 5123. (Modified from a tutorial I did several years ago)
